🩺 **Disease Predictor**

📌 **Overview**
The Disease Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict possible diseases based on patient symptoms and health attributes. By leveraging classification algorithms, the model can analyze input data and provide disease predictions that can assist in preliminary healthcare diagnostics.

This project is implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebook and integrates multiple ML libraries for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

🚀 **Features**
✅ Data preprocessing and cleaning for healthcare datasets

✅ Training machine learning models for disease prediction

✅ Model evaluation with accuracy metrics and visualization

✅ Exporting trained models for reuse in future applications

✅ Interactive step-by-step workflow through Jupyter Notebook

🛠 **Technologies Used**
Python 3.x

NumPy, Pandas → Data handling and preprocessing

Scikit-learn → ML algorithms & model training

Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data visualization

Joblib / Pickle → Model persistence and export

📊 **Example Workflow**
Load dataset (symptoms and diseases)

Preprocess and clean the data

Train model (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, etc.)

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall

Save and reuse trained model

🔮 **Future Improvements**
🌐 Build a Streamlit or Flask Web App for user-friendly interaction

📈 Expand dataset for broader disease coverage

🤖 Integrate Deep Learning models for improved accuracy

☁️ Deploy application on Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, or Heroku)
